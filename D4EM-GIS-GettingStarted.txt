1. Check out all of D4EM from:
   https://d4em.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
   (instructions assume this is saved in the local folder D4EM)

2. Create the folder if it does not yet exist:
   D4EM\bin\Debug
   Copy the folder:
   D4EM\Externals\AnyCPU\GDAL
   so it becomes:
   D4EM\bin\Debug\GDAL

3. Open D4EM\D4EM-GIS.sln

4. Make sure D4EM-GIS is the startup project.

5. In Configuration Manager, make sure 
   "Active solution configuration" is Debug
   "Active solution platform" is Any CPU
   For all projects, make sure Configuration is Debug.
   For D4EM-GIS (the main program) make sure Platform is x86.
   For all other projects, make sure Platform is Any CPU.

6. Rebuild Solution
